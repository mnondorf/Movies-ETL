## Summary
The purpose of this project was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data in its raw form, cleans it, transforms it into readable formats, and loads it into existing tables for the client, Amazing Prime. 

This task was accomplished by creating functions in Pandas using Python that automate the above-mentioned processes and loading the resulting databases into PostgeSQL using SQLAlchemy.

The automated pipeline can be used on a daily basis to analyze new data that is added to the databases as they are updated.
